# Arrays and Destructuring Challenge

The scripts file contains code that extracts numbers from 
arrays contained in the "lists" array and combines all values 
into a single array called result. It orders the numbers in 
result by removing the biggest value amongst the last numbers
 in each array in "lists" and moving it to the "results" array.

This was a challenge given by codespace to students, in which 
we had to edit an incorrect code so that it functions correctly
